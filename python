#1
A bicyclist cycles around a circular park with a pathway connecting two opposite end points of
the path of length 7kms. Develop a logic that computes the total distance covered by the cyclist
for a given set of rounds cycled.
Input : Enter No. of Rounds : 10
Output : ‘x’ Kms travelled.


print("Enter No. of Rounds:")
rounds = int(input())
radius = 7/2
circumference = radius * 2 * (3.14)
print(str(rounds*circumference) + "Kms travelled")







#2
A fixed set of positive integers is dictated by the mathematics professor during a puzzle contest.
The professor asks the students to find a pair of numbers that result in a given sum. Code a
logic that can automate this puzzle. Use the below input for your exercise.
Case – 1
Input : arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6] & Sum = 8
Output : 2,6
Case – 2
Input : arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 9] & Sum = 8
Ouput: No Pairs found


arr = list(map(int ,input().split()))
s = int(input())
flag = 0
for i in arr:
    res = s - i
    if res in arr and res!=i:
        print(i , res)
        flag = 1
        break
if flag==0:    
    print("No Pairs found")    


#3Alice is a cryptanalyst who is in charge of transmitting messages to bob without any intruder
getting hands on it. Alice thinks of transmitting the message by reversing it with a random
character appended as prefix to the encoded message.
Input : Pentafox
Ouput: Oxofatnep


import random
word = list(input())
word = word[::-1]
Random_to_chose = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z']
random_letter = random.choice(Random_to_chose)
word.insert(0,random_letter)
for i in word:
    print(i,end="")



#4As a computer engineer, you are requested to reduce the storage space needed to store the
textual content in the computer. Write a logic that can compress the content as given in the
below example.
Input : All is well.
Output : Al2 is wel2 (Character followed by its number of occurrence)



word = list(input())
i = 0
while(i<len(word)):
    count = 1
    temp = word[i]
    while((i+1)<len(word) and word[i+1]==temp):
        count+=1
        del word[i]
    if count>1:
        word.insert(i+1,str(count))
    i+=count 
listToStr = ''.join([str(s) for s in word])   
print(listToStr)   






#5 In a puzzle contest, the chairman of your English club posts a problem to compare a given pair
of words and eliminate all common characters in them. To speed up the process of judging, the
computer club head was requested to prepare computer logic. Please code a solution to the
above problem applying your own skillset.
Input : Word-1: Rajesh Word-2: Ganesh
Output : RjGn


first_name = list(input())
second_name = list(input())
for i in first_name:
    if i not in second_name:
        print(i,end="")
for i in second_name:
    if i not in first_name:
        print(i,end="")

#6A school camp is organized by a school to support the process of preparing their students for
an examination. They are in need of a study timetable that has following assumptions:
Assumptions:
1. Total Days of Camp – 5 Days
2. Total Hours a day – 5 Days
3. Total Subjects – 5 Subjects
Note: The timetable should not follow the same order and should be in random everyday.
Prepare code logic to help the School.


import random        
tot_days = 5
tot_hrs = 5
subjects = {1:"sub1",2:"sub2",3:"sub3",4:"sub4",5:"sub5"}
random_generator = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in range(1,tot_days+1):
    li = [] 
    print("DAY",i,end="   ")
    while(len(li)!=5):
        number = random.choice(random_generator)
        if number not in li:
            li.append(number)       
    for i in range(0,len(li)):
        number = li[i]
        print(subjects[number],end=" ")
    print()
        

#7The alphabetical value is represented from 1-26 for characters A-Z respectively. Using this
principle generate a crypto decoder that can generate the message for transmitted sequence of
alphabetical values.
Input : 1,2,3,4,26
Output : ABCDZ



numbers = list(map(int ,input().split()))
for i in numbers:
    print(chr(i+64),end="")
